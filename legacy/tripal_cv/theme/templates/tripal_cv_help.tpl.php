<h3>Module Description:</h3>
<p>The Tripal CV (Controlled Vocabularies) Module provides
    functionality for managing controlled vocabularies and the terms they are
    comprised of. The flexibility and extendibility of the chado schema depends
    on controlled vocabularies. For example, by using a controlled vocabulary
    for
    feature types the chado schema can describe features of any type, even those
    we have not concieved of yet.</p>

<h3>Setup Instructions:</h3>
<p>After installation of the controlled vocabulary module, the following tasks
    should be performed:</p>
<ol>
    <li><p><b>Set Permissions</b>: By default only the site administrator
            account has access to create, edit, delete
            or administer vocabularies and terms. Navigate to
            the <?php print l('permissions page', 'admin/user/permissions') ?>
            and set the
            permissions under the 'tripal_cv' section as appropriate for your
            site. For a simple setup, allow anonymous
            users access to view content and create a special role for creating,
            editing and other administrative tasks.</p></li>

    <li><p><b>Loading of Ontologies/Controlled Vocabularies</b>: You can access
            this loader at <?php
        print l('Admin->Tripal Management->Tripal CV->Load Ontology With OBO File', 'admin/tripal/loaders/chado_vocabs/obo_loader')
        ?>. This loader allows you to choose from a list of common ontologies or
            enter the URL or location to an OBO file. Even the list of common
            ontologies is using a URL ensuring you get the most up to date
            ontology.</p>
        <p>NOTE: in some cases, community developed ontologies for your
            data may not yet be developed. In this case, it is suggested that
            you begin
            developement of an ontology using one of the online tools. You might
            find
            that many researchers are trying to deal with the same data and are
            willing
            to help you in this endevor. </p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Features of this Module:</h3>
<p>Aside from the data loading described above, the Tripal Controlled Vocabulary
    (CV) module also provides the following functionality:</p>
<ul>
    <li><p><b>Create/Update/Delete A Controlled Vocaulbulary</b>: to create your
            own controlled vocabulary go to
        <?php l('the page for adding a vocbulary', 'admin/tripal/tripal_cv/cv/add') ?>
            and
            fill out the form provided. To Update/Delete a controlled vocabulary
            go to
        <?php print l('the page for editing a vocuabulary', 'admin/tripal/tripal_cv/cv/edit') ?>
            ,
            select the existing vocabulary you want to modify and then
            edit it as desired. This only modifies the vocabulary itself. See
            the next section for adding, removing, editing
            the terms of a vocabulary.</p></li>

    <li><p><b>Create a Controlled Vocaulbulary Term</b>: Use
        <?php print l('the page for adding a new CV term', 'admin/tripal/tripal_cv/cvterm/add') ?>
            ,
            select the controlled vocabulary you want to add terms to and then
            fill
            out the form.</p></li>

</ul>
