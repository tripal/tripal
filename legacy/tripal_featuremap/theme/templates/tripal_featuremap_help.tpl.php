<h3>Module Description:</h3>
<p>The Tripal Map module is an interface for the Chado Map module which groups
    features (sequences) into
    maps (typically genetic maps).
    This module provides support for visualization of "map" pages, editing and
    updating.
</p>

<h3>Setup Instructions:</h3>
<ol>
    <li><p><b>Set Permissions</b>: By default only the site administrator
            account has access to create, edit, delete
            or administer maps. Navigate to
            the <?php print l('permissions page', 'admin/user/permissions') ?>
            and set the
            permissions under the 'tripal_featuremap' section as appropriate for
            your site. For a simple setup, allow anonymous
            users access to view content and create a special role for creating,
            editing and other administrative tasks.</p></li>

    <li><p><b>Create a Map</b>: An map (called a feature map in Chado) can
            be <?php print l('created', 'node/add/chado-featuremap') ?>
            manually in the same way any other data type. There is no loader for
            loading large files of map information including
            features that may be associated with these maps (e.g. genetic
            markers). The Tripal bulk loader is the only way
            to load this type of data.</p></li>

    <li><p><b>Sync any Existing Maps</b>: Before Maps can be viewed on the
            website, they must first
            be <?php print l('created manually', 'node/add/chado-featuremap') ?>
            or if they already exist in the Chado database they must be synced.
            Near the top of
            the <?php print l('Map Configuration page', 'admin/tripal/tripal_featuremap/configuration') ?>
            there is
            a Sync Maps section which provides list of maps currently in chado
            which can be sync\'d.
            Simply select the maps you would like to create Drupal/Tripal pages
            for and click Sync Maps. Once synced,
            pages will appear on the site for maps.</p></li>

</ol>


<h3>Features of this Module:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><p><b>Edit or Delete Maps</b>: Maps can be manually edited or deleted by
            navigating to the map page and clicking the "Edit" button.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Simple Search Tool</b>:
            A <?php print l('simple search tool', 'chado/featuremaps') ?> is
            provided for
            finding maps. This tool relies on Drupal Views. <a
                    href="http://drupal.org/project/views">Drupal Views</a>
            which must be installed to see the search tool. Look for it in the
            navigation menu under the item
            "Search Data". </p></li>
</ul>
