<h3>Module Description:</h3>
<p>The Tripal Analysis module provides a new analysis content type that is
    intended to be
    used when a more specialized analysis module does not exist. Because it is
    generic, it does not
    provide any visualization or data loading tools for analysis data.
    Specialized analysis modules,
    such as the Tripal Analysis Blast or Tripal Analysis KEGG modules provide
    loading and custom
    visualizations for the analysis results. These modules must be installed
    separately.
</p>

<h3>Setup Instructions:</h3>
<p>After installation of the analysis module or any specialized analysis module.
    The following tasks should be performed</p>
<ol>
    <li><p><b>Set Permissions</b>: By default only the site administrator
            account has access to create, edit, delete
            or administer analyses. Navigate to
            the <?php print l('permissions page', 'admin/user/permissions') ?>
            and set the
            permissions under the 'tripal_analysis' section as appropriate for
            your site. For a simple setup, allow anonymous
            users access to view content and create a special role for creating,
            editing and other administrative tasks.</p></li>


    <li><p><b>Create an Analysis</b>: An analysis should
            be <?php print l('created', 'node/add/chado-analysis') ?> before
            data is imported into chado. The generic analysis type should only
            be used when a more specialized analysis module
            (e.g. Tripal Analysis Blast module) does not already exists. All
            data imported into Chado should be associated with
            an analysis to help keep track of the source for data.</p></li>

    <li><p><b>Sync Analyses</b>: If you have analyses already stored in Chado
            and would like to create pages for them, then
            analyses can be synced using the
        <?php print l('analysis configuration page', 'admin/tripal/tripal_analysis/configuration') ?>
            . The process of 'syncing'
            automatically creates the pages as if you had created them using the
            step above.
        </p></li>
</ol>


<h3>Additional Features of this Module:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><p><b>Simple Search Tool</b>:
            A <?php print l('simple search tool', 'chado/analyses') ?> is
            provided for
            finding analyses. This tool relies on Drupal Views. <a
                    href="http://drupal.org/project/views">Drupal Views</a>
            which must be installed to see the search tool. Look for it in the
            navigation menu under the item
            "Search Data". </p></li>
</ul>
