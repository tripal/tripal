/* Typically in a Tripal template, the data needed is retrieved using a call to
 * chado_expand_var function.  For example, to retrieve all 
 * of the contact relationships for this node, the following function call would be made:
 * 
 *   $contact = chado_expand_var($contact,'table','contact_relationship');
 * 
 * However, this function call can be extremely slow when there are numerous relationships.
 * This is because the chado_expand_var function is recursive and expands 
 * all data following the foreign key relationships tree.  Therefore, to speed retrieval
 * of data, a special variable is provided to this template:
 * 
 *   $contact->all_relationships;
 *   
 * This variable is an array with two sub arrays with the keys 'object' and 'subject'.  The array with
 * key 'object' contains relationships where the contact is the object, and the array with
 * the key 'subject' contains relationships where the contact is the subject
