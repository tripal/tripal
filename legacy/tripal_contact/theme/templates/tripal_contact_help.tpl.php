</p>

<h3>Setup Instructions:</h3>
<ol>
    <li><p><b>Set Permissions</b>: By default only the site administrator
            account has access to create, edit, delete
            or administer contacts. Navigate to
            the <?php print l('permissions page', 'admin/user/permissions') ?>
            and set the
            permissions under the 'tripal_contact' section as appropriate for
            your site. For a simple setup, allow anonymous
            users access to view content and create a special role for creating,
            editing and other administrative tasks.</p></li>

    <li><p><b>Create a Contact</b>: An contact can
            be <?php print l('created', 'node/add/chado-contact') ?>
            manually in the same way any other data type. Contacts may also be
            created automatically by using the
            publication module publication importers. Alternatively, the Tripal
            bulk loader may also be used to load contacts.</p></li>

    <li><p><b>Sync any Existing Contacts</b>: Before Contacts can be viewed on
            the website, they must first
            be <?php print l('created manually', 'node/add/chado-contact') ?>
            or if they already exist in the Chado database
            they <?php print l('must be synced', 'admin/tripal/tripal_contact/sync') ?>
            with Drupal.
            Once synced, contact pages will appear on the site.</p></li>
</ol>
