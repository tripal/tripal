<h3>Module Description:</h3>
<p>The Tripal Library module is an interface for the Chado Library module which
    groups features (sequences) into genetic libraries.
    This module provides support for visualization of "library" pages, editing
    and updating.</p>

<h3>Setup Instructions:</h3>
<ol>
    <li><p><b>Set Permissions</b>: By default only the site administrator
            account has access to create, edit, delete
            or administer features. Navigate to
            the <?php print l('permissions page', 'admin/user/permissions') ?>
            and set the
            permissions under the 'tripal_library' section as appropriate for
            your site. For a simple setup, allow anonymous
            users access to view content and create a special role for creating,
            editing and other administrative tasks.</p></li>

    <li><p><b>Sync any Existing Libraries</b>: Near the top of
            the <?php l('Library Configuration page', 'admin/tripal/tripal_library/configuration') ?>
            there is
            a Sync Libraries section which provides list of libraries currently
            in chado which can be synced.
            Simply select the libraries you would like to create Drupal/Tripal
            pages for and click Sync Libraries.</p></li>
</ol>


<h3>Features of this Module:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Add/Edit/Delete Libraries</b>: Libraries with no associated features
        can be created <?php print l('here', 'node/add/chado-library') ?>.
        Existing Libraries (regardless of the method used to create them) can be
        edited or deleted by clicking the Edit tab at the top of the Library
        Page.
    </li>

    <li><p><b>Simple Search Tool</b>:
            A <?php print l('simple search tool', 'chado/libraries') ?> is
            provided for
            finding libraries. This tool relies on Drupal Views. <a
                    href="http://drupal.org/project/views">Drupal Views</a>
            which must be installed to see the search tool. Look for it in the
            navigation menu under the item
            "Search Data". </p></li>
</ul>
