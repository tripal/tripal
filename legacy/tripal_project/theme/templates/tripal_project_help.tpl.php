<h3>Module Description:</h3>
<p>The Tripal Project module provides support for visualization of "project"
    pages, editing and updating.</p>

<h3>Setup Instructions:</h3>
<ol>
    <li><p><b>Set Permissions</b>: By default only the site administrator
            account has access to create, edit, delete
            or administer features. Navigate to
            the <?php print l('permissions page', 'admin/user/permissions') ?>
            and set the
            permissions under the 'tripal_project' section as appropriate for
            your site. For a simple setup, allow anonymous
            users access to view content and create a special role for creating,
            editing and other administrative tasks.</p></li>

    <li><p><b>Sync any Existing Projects</b>: Near the top of
            the <?php print l('Project Configuration page', 'admin/tripal/tripal_project/configuration') ?>
            there is
            a Sync Projects section which provides list of projects currently in
            chado which can be sync\'d.
            Simply select the projects you would like to create Drupal/Tripal
            pages for and click Sync Projects.</p></li>
