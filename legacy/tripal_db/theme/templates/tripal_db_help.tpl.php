<h3>Module Description:</h3>
<p>The Tripal DB Module provides the ability to add database cross reference to
    the
    data in your Tripal Website. Typically an external database (such as NCBI
    Genbank, Gene Ontology (GO),
    stocks database) contains a collection of objects (genomic sequences,
    vocabulary terms, stocks) that are
    uniquely identified using an accession number (or identifier). Data loaded
    into Tripal can be a
    associated with these objects in remote databases, and links can appear on
    pages allowing site visitors
    to view the associated objects on the remote database\'s website </p>

<h3>Setup Instructions:</h3>
<ol>
    <li><p><b>Set Permissions</b>: By default only the site administrator
            account has access to
            or administer databases. Navigate to
            the <?php print l('permissions page', 'admin/user/permissions') ?>
            and set the
            permissions under the 'tripal_db' section as appropriate for your
            site. For a simple setup, allow anonymous
            users access to view content and create a special role for creating,
            editing and other administrative tasks.</p></li>

    <li><p><b>Adding or Editing an External Databases</b>. Many resources such
            as NCBI nr or ExPASy SwissProt (to name a few)
            come pre-loaded with Chado. However, you can add new entries or edit
            existing entries. Also, when loading
            ontologies (controlled vocabularies) using the Tripal CV module new
            databases are added automaticaly for
            each ontology. To enable linking of accession on a page to the page
            for that accession on the external
            database, simply add the URL and the URL prefix when adding or
            editing a database.</p></li>

    <li><p><b>Associate Data with Accessions</b>. The Tripal loaders (e.g. GFF,
            OBO) can associate accessions from
            remote data to genomic features and controlled vocabularies
            automatically. Use the loaders to load genomic
            features and controlled vocabularies respectively. Additionally, the
            bulk loader can be used to create
            loading templates for associating external database accessions.
