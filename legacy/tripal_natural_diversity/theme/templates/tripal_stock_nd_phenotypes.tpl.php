/*
 * Phenotype relationships with stocks are stored in the natural diversity tables.
 * If a stock has phenotypes associated then you can find the data by traversing
 * the foreign key (FK) relationships in this manner:
 *
 * stock => nd_experiment_stock => nd_experiment => nd_experiment_phenotype => phenotype.
 *
 * You can find ancillary information about data associated with a phenotype such as
 * a contact, pub, protocol, project, phenotype, dbxref by using the
 * nd_experiment.nd_experiment_id value and traversing the other FK relationships
 *
 * stock => nd_experiment_stock => nd_experiment => nd_experiment_phenotype => phenotype
 *                                               => nd_experiment_phenotype => phenotype
 *                                               => nd_experiment_project => project
 *                                               => nd_experiment_pub => pub
 *                                               => nd_experiment_contact => contact
 *                                               => nd_experiment_dbxref => dbxref
 *                                               => nd_experiment_protocol => protocol
 *                                               => nd_experiment_stockprop
 *                                               => nd_experiment_stock_dbxref
 *
 * In the FK relationships shown above, the nd_experiment_id value represents a single
 * experimental value that may have all of the ancilliary data associated with it.
 * If the phenotype record shares an nd_experiment_id with a phenotype, pub, contact,
 * protocol, etc then all of that data is associated with the phenotype and vice-versa.
 *
 * Techincally, we can skip including the 'nd_experiment' table when traversing the FK's
 * because we have the nd_experiment_id value when we get the nd_experiment_stock record.
 *
 * When lots of phenotypes are associated with a stock (e.g. thousands) then traversing
 * the FK relationships as described above can be very slow. Ideally, we only need to
 * show a small subset with a pager. Therefore, a list of nd_experiment_phenotype_id's
 * are provided to this template automatically within the stock object.
