/*
* Typically in a Tripal template, the data needed is retrieved using a call to
* chado_expand_var function.  For example, to retrieve all 
* of the feature alignments for this node, the following function call would be made:
* 
*   $feature = chado_expand_var($feature,'table','featureloc');
*   
* However, this will return all records from the featureloc table without any context.
* To help provide context, a special variable is provided to this template named
* 'all_featurelocs'.   
* 
*   $feature->all_featurelocs
*   
* The records in the 'all_featurelocs' array are all properly arranged for easy iteration.
* 
* However, access to the original alignment records is possible through the 
* $feature->featureloc object.  In the following ways:  
*
* Alignment context #1:
* --------------------
* If the feature for this node is the parent in the alignment relationships,
* then those alignments are available in this variable:
* 
*    $feature->featureloc->srcfeature_id;
*    
*
* Alignment context #2:
* ---------------------
* If the feature for this node is the child in the alignment relationsips,
* then those alignments are available in this variable:
* 
*   $feature->featureloc->feature_id;
*   
*
* Alignment context #3:
* --------------------
* If the feature is aligned to another through an intermediary feature (e.g.
* a feature of type 'match', 'EST_match', 'primer_match', etc) then those
* alignments are stored in this variable:
*   feature->matched_featurelocs
*
* Below is an example of a feature that may be aligned to another through
* an intermediary:
*
*    Feature 1: Contig      ---------------   (left feature)
*    Feature 2: EST_match           -------
*    Feature 3: EST                 --------- (right feature)
*
* The feature for this node is always "Feature 1".  The purpose of this type 
* alignment is to indicate cases where there is the potential for overhang
* in the alignments, or, the ends of the features are not part of the alignment
* prehaps due to poor quality of the ends.  Blast results and ESTs mapped to
* contigs in Unigenes would fall under this category.
*
