COMMENT ON TABLE featureloc IS 'The location of a feature relative to
another feature. Important: interbase coordinates are used. This is
vital as it allows us to represent zero-length features e.g. splice
sites, insertion points without an awkward fuzzy system. Features
typically have exactly ONE location, but this need not be the
case. Some features may not be localized (e.g. a gene that has been
characterized genetically but no sequence or molecular information is
available). Note on multiple locations: Each feature can have 0 or
more locations. Multiple locations do NOT indicate non-contiguous
locations (if a feature such as a transcript has a non-contiguous
location, then the subfeatures such as exons should always be
manifested). Instead, multiple featurelocs for a feature designate
alternate locations or grouped locations; for instance, a feature
designating a blast hit or hsp will have two locations, one on the
query feature, one on the subject feature. Features representing
sequence variation could have alternate locations instantiated on a
feature on the mutant strain. The column:rank is used to
differentiate these different locations. Reflexive locations should
never be stored - this is for -proper- (i.e. non-self) locations only; nothing should be located relative to itself.';

COMMENT ON COLUMN featureloc.feature_id IS 'The feature that is being located. Any feature can have zero or more featurelocs.';

COMMENT ON COLUMN featureloc.srcfeature_id IS 'The source feature which this location is relative to. Every location is relative to another feature (however, this column is nullable, because the srcfeature may not be known). All locations are -proper- that is, nothing should be located relative to itself. No cycles are allowed in the featureloc graph.';

COMMENT ON COLUMN featureloc.fmin IS 'The leftmost/minimal boundary in the linear range represented by the featureloc. Sometimes (e.g. in Bioperl) this is called -start- although this is confusing because it does not necessarily represent the 5-prime coordinate. Important: This is space-based (interbase) coordinates, counting from zero. To convert this to the leftmost position in a base-oriented system (eg GFF, Bioperl), add 1 to fmin.';

COMMENT ON COLUMN featureloc.fmax IS 'The rightmost/maximal boundary in the linear range represented by the featureloc. Sometimes (e.g. in bioperl) this is called -end- although this is confusing because it does not necessarily represent the 3-prime coordinate. Important: This is space-based (interbase) coordinates, counting from zero. No conversion is required to go from fmax to the rightmost coordinate in a base-oriented system that counts from 1 (e.g. GFF, Bioperl).';

COMMENT ON COLUMN featureloc.strand IS 'The orientation/directionality of the
location. Should be 0, -1 or +1.';

COMMENT ON COLUMN featureloc.rank IS 'Used when a feature has >1
location, otherwise the default rank 0 is used. Some features (e.g.
blast hits and HSPs) have two locations - one on the query and one on
the subject. Rank is used to differentiate these. Rank=0 is always
used for the query, Rank=1 for the subject. For multiple alignments,
assignment of rank is arbitrary. Rank is also used for
sequence_variant features, such as SNPs. Rank=0 indicates the wildtype
(or baseline) feature, Rank=1 indicates the mutant (or compared) feature.';

COMMENT ON COLUMN featureloc.locgroup IS 'This is used to manifest redundant,
derivable extra locations for a feature. The default locgroup=0 is
used for the DIRECT location of a feature. Important: most Chado users may
never use featurelocs WITH logroup > 0. Transitively derived locations
are indicated with locgroup > 0. For example, the position of an exon on
a BAC and in global chromosome coordinates. This column is used to
differentiate these groupings of locations. The default locgroup 0
is used for the main or primary location, from which the others can be
derived via coordinate transformations. Another example of redundant
locations is storing ORF coordinates relative to both transcript and
genome. Redundant locations open the possibility of the database
getting into inconsistent states; this schema gives us the flexibility
of both warehouse instantiations with redundant locations (easier for
querying) and management instantiations with no redundant
locations. An example of using both locgroup and rank: imagine a
feature indicating a conserved region between the chromosomes of two
different species. We may want to keep redundant locations on both
contigs and chromosomes. We would thus have 4 locations for the single
conserved region feature - two distinct locgroups (contig level and
chromosome level) and two distinct ranks (for the two species).';

COMMENT ON COLUMN featureloc.residue_info IS 'Alternative residues,
when these differ from feature.residues. For instance, a SNP feature
located on a wild and mutant protein would have different alternative residues.
for alignment/similarity features, the alternative residues is used to
represent the alignment string (CIGAR format). Note on variation
features; even if we do not want to instantiate a mutant
chromosome/contig feature, we can still represent a SNP etc with 2
locations, one (rank 0) on the genome, the other (rank 1) would have
most fields null, except for alternative residues.';

COMMENT ON COLUMN featureloc.phase IS 'Phase of translation with
respect to srcfeature_id.
Values are 0, 1, 2. It may not be possible to manifest this column for
some features such as exons, because the phase is dependant on the
spliceform (the same exon can appear in multiple spliceforms). This column is mostly useful for predicted exons and CDSs.';

--Evolution of the methods found in range.plpgsql (C. Pommier)
--Goal : increase performances of segment fetching
--       Implies to optimise featureloc_slice

--Background : The existing featureloc_slice uses uses a spatial rtree index. The spatial objects used are a boxrange ((0,fmin), (fmax,500000000)) and a boxquery ((fmin,fmax),(fmin,fmax)) . The boxranges are indexed. 
--             To speed up things (for gbrowse) featureloc_slice has been overiden to filter simultaneously on the boxrange and the srcfeature_id. This gives good results.
--             The goal here is to push this logic further and to include the srcfeature_id filter directly into the boxrange object. We propose to consider the following boxs : 
--             boxrange : ((srcfeature_id,fmin),(srcfeature_id,fmax))
--             boxquery : ((srcfeature_id,fmin),(srcfeature_id,fmax))

-- studyprop and studyprop_feature added for Kara Dolinski's group
-- 
-- Here is her description of it:
--Both of the tables are used for our YFGdb project 
--(http://yfgdb.princeton.edu/), which uses chado. 
--
--Here is how we use those tables, using the following example:
--
--http://yfgdb.princeton.edu/cgi-bin/display.cgi?db=pmid&amp;id=15575969
--
--The above data set is represented as a row in the STUDY table.  We have
--lots of attributes that we want to store about each STUDY (status, etc)
--and in the official schema, the only prop table we could use was the
--STUDYDESIGN_PROP table.  This forced us to go through the STUDYDESIGN 
--table when we often have no real data to store in that table (small 
--percent of our collection use MAGE-ML unfortunately, and even fewer 
--provide all the data in the MAGE model, of which STUDYDESIGN is a vestige). 
--So, we created a STUDYPROP table.  I'd think this table would be 
--generally useful to people storing various types of data sets via the 
--STUDY table.
--
--The other new table is STUDYPROP_FEATURE.  This basically allows us to
--group features together per study.  For example, we can store microarray
--clustering results by saying that the STUDYPROP type is 'cluster'  (via 
--type_id -> CVTERM of course), the value is 'cluster id 123', and then
--that cluster would be associated with all the features that are in that
--cluster via STUDYPROP_FEATURE.  Adding type_id to STUDYPROP_FEATURE is
-- fine by us!
