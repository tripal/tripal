COMMENT ON TABLE chado.analysis IS 'An analysis is a particular type of a computational analysis; it may be a blast of one sequence against another, or an all by all blast, or a different kind of analysis altogether. It can be a single unit of computation or an analysis that represents a set of computational steps. For example, a reference genome assembly could be stored as a single record in the analysis table, but this analysis could encompass many individual analysis steps (read trimming, assembly, scaffolding, etc). These could be stored and related via the analysis_relationship table.'
