    -   label: Genetic Map
        term: data:1278
        help_text: Use a genetic map page for a map showing the relative positions of genetic markers in a nucleic acid sequence, based on estimation of non-physical distance such as recombination frequencies.

    -   label: QTL
        term: SO:0000771
        help_text: Use a QTL page for a quantitative trait locus (QTL), which is a polymorphic locus which contains alleles that differentially affect the expression of a continuously distributed phenotypic trait. Usually it is a marker described by statistical association to quantitative variation in the particular phenotypic trait that is thought to be controlled by the cumulative action of alleles at multiple loci.

    -   label: Sequence Variant
        term: SO:0001060
        help_text: Use the sequence variant page for a non exact copy of a sequence feature or genome exhibiting one or more sequence alteration.

    -   label: Genetic Marker
        term: SO:0001645
        help_text: Use the genetic marker page for a measurable sequence feature that varies within a population.

    -   label: Heritable Phenotypic Marker
        term: SO:0001500
        help_text: Use the heritable phenotypic marker page for a sequence region characterized as a single heritable trait in a phenotype screen. The heritable phenotype may be mapped to a chromosome but generally has not been characterized to a specific gene locus.
