    -   label: Gene
        term: SO:0000704
        help_text: Use the gene page for a region (or regions) that includes all of the sequence elements necessary to encode a functional transcript. A gene may include regulatory regions, transcribed regions and/or other functional sequence regions.

    -   label: mRNA
        term: SO:0000234
        help_text: Use the mRNA page for a messenger RNA which is the intermediate molecule between DNA and protein. It includes UTR and coding sequences. It does not contain introns.

    -   label: Phylogenetic Tree
        term: data:0872
        help_text: Use the phylogenetic tree page for data or plotting of phylogenetic trees. Usually includes information such as topology, lengths (in time or in expected amounts of variance) and a confidence interval for each length.

    -   label: Physical Map
        term: data:1280
        help_text: Use the physical map page for a map of annotated with physical features or landmarks such as restriction sites, cloned DNA fragments, genes or genetic markers, along with the physical distances between them. Distance in a physical map is measured in base pairs. A physical map might be ordered relative to a reference map (typically a genetic map) in the process of genome sequencing.
