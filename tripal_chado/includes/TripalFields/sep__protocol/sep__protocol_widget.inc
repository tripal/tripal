   * Provides the form for editing of this field.
   *
   * This function corresponds to the hook_field_widget_form()
   * function of the Drupal Field API.
   *
   * This form is diplayed when the user creates a new entity or edits an
   * existing entity.  If the field is attached to the entity then the form
   * provided by this function will be displayed.
   *
   * At a minimum, the form must have a 'value' element.  For Tripal, the
   * 'value' element of a field always corresponds to the value that is
   * presented to the end-user either directly on the page (with formatting)
   * or via web services, or some other mechanism.  However, the 'value' is
   * sometimes not enough for a field.  For example, the Tripal Chado module
   * maps fields to table columns and sometimes those columns are foreign keys
   * therefore, the Tripal Chado modules does not just use the 'value' but adds
   * additional elements to help link records via FKs.  But even in this case
   * the 'value' element must always be present in the return form and in such
   * cases it's value should be set equal to that added in the 'load' function.
   *
   * @param $widget
   * @param $form
   *   The form structure where widgets are being attached to. This might be a
   *   full form structure, or a sub-element of a larger form.
   * @param $form_state
   *   An associative array containing the current state of the form.
   * @param $langcode
   *   The language associated with $items.
   * @param $items
   *   Array of default values for this field.
   * @param $delta
   *   The order of this item in the array of subelements (0, 1, 2, etc).
   * @param $element
   * A form element array containing basic properties for the widget:
   *  - #entity_type: The name of the entity the field is attached to.
   *  - #bundle: The name of the field bundle the field is contained in.
   *  - #field_name: The name of the field.
   *  - #language: The language the field is being edited in.
   *  - #field_parents: The 'parents' space for the field in the form. Most
   *    widgets can simply overlook this property. This identifies the location
   *    where the field values are placed within $form_state['values'], and is
   *    used to access processing information for the field through the
   *    field_form_get_state() and field_form_set_state() functions.
   *  - #columns: A list of field storage columns of the field.
   *  - #title: The sanitized element label for the field instance, ready for
   *    output.
   *  - #description: The sanitized element description for the field instance,
   *    ready for output.
   *  - #required: A Boolean indicating whether the element value is required;
   *    for required multiple value fields, only the first widget's values are
   *    required.
   *  - #delta: The order of this item in the array of subelements; see
   *    $delta above

   * Drupal typically does not provide a submit hook for fields.  The
   * TripalField provides one to allow for behind-the-scenes actions to
   * occur.   This function should never be used for updates, deletes or
   * inserts for the Chado table associated with the field.  Rather, the
   * storage backend should be allowed to handle inserts, updates deletes.
   * However, it is permissible to perform inserts, updates or deletions within
   * Chado using this function.  Those operations can be performed if needed but
   * on other tables not directly associated with the field.
   *
   * An example is the chado.feature_synonym table.  The chado_linker__synonym
   * field allows the user to provide a brand new synonynm and it must add it
   * to the chado.synonym table prior to the record in the
   * chado.feature_synonym table.  This insert occurs in the widgetFormSubmit
   * function.
   *
   * @param $form
   *    The submitted form array.
   * @param $form_state .

   * @param $entity
   *    The entity for the operation.
   * @param $langcode
   *    The language associated with $items.
