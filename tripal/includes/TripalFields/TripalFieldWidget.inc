   * Provides the form for editing of this field.

   *
   * This form is diplayed when the user creates a new entity or edits an
   * existing entity.  If the field is attached to the entity then the form
   * provided by this function will be displayed.
   *
   * At a minimum, the form must have a 'value' element.  For Tripal, the
   * 'value' element of a field always corresponds to the value that is
   * presented to the end-user either directly on the page (with formatting)
   * or via web services, or some other mechanism.  However, the 'value' is
   * sometimes not enough for a field.  For example, the Tripal Chado module
   * maps fields to table columns and sometimes those columns are foreign keys
   * therefore, the Tripal Chado modules does not just use the 'value' but adds
   * additional elements to help link records via FKs.  But even in this case
   * the 'value' element must always be present in the return form and in such
   * cases it's value should be set equal to that added in the 'load' function.
   *
   * @param $widget
   * @param $form

   *   The order of this item in the array of subelements (0, 1, 2, etc).
   * @param $element
   * A form element array containing basic properties for the widget:
   *  - #entity_type: The name of the entity the field is attached to.
   *  - #bundle: The name of the field bundle the field is contained in.
   *  - #field_name: The name of the field.
   *  - #language: The language the field is being edited in.
   *  - #field_parents: The 'parents' space for the field in the form. Most
   *    widgets can simply overlook this property. This identifies the location
   *    where the field values are placed within $form_state['values'], and is
   *    used to access processing information for the field through the
   *    field_form_get_state() and field_form_set_state() functions.

   * inserts for the Chado table associated with the field.  Rather, the

   * However, it is permissible to perform inserts, updates or deletions within
   * Chado using this function.  Those operations can be performed if needed but
   * on other tables not directly associated with the field.
   *
   * An example is the chado.feature_synonym table.  The chado_linker__synonym
   * field allows the user to provide a brand new synonynm and it must add it
   * to the chado.synonym table prior to the record in the
   * chado.feature_synonym table.  This insert occurs in the widgetFormSubmit
